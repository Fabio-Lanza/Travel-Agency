        Just home from the wonderful trip you recommended 
        to Australia with Linda SIm and David Tarrant. 
        Not only was the trip mind blowing in itâ€™s 
        selection of gardens, hotels, meals ....oh the meals
        !...but the group was collaborative and most
         interesting being mainly from areas close to us

        I am so thankful you guys are my travel agents as 
        I am to overwhelmed with everything else to shop 
        for airplane tickets. You know you are much more 
        than travel people. You are my friends, and that
         means a great deal to me.
